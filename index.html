                <p class="lead mb-3">You hired a senior dev who said they knew what they were doing. They don't.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Someone on Reddit said "just use microservices." Should you? You have no idea.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Your tech stack is held together with duct tape. But a rewrite would kill your momentum.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">You need someone to talk to. Someone who's been there. Someone who won't bullshit you.</p>
