                <p class="mb-3">I've seen $50M rewrites that never shipped. Teams paralyzed by "senior" hires who made everything worse. Startups that scaled their architecture before finding customers. Enterprises that moved so slow they got eaten by competitors.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">27 years. Built and sold a SaaS. Still run production systems. I know what breaks.</p>

                <h3 class="handwritten fs-2 text-teal mb-4 text-center">What I help with:</h3>
                <ul class="list-unstyled mb-5">
                    <li class="mb-2">Should you rewrite this? (Usually no)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Are your devs the problem? (Usually not the only problem)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Is this hire actually good? How do you tell?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">How do you break down features that actually ship?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">What's the quickest fix vs the ideal solution vs the practical middle ground?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Where should AI generate vs where should humans maintain?</li>
                </ul>
