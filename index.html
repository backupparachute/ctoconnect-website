                <p class="lead mb-3">Your devs keep missing deadlines.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">You've been waiting 2 months for a feature that should take 2 weeks. Your competitor shipped it in 3 weeks. You're losing customers to them.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">You're thinking about a rewrite.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">You told the team "6 months." They said "doable." It's been 8 months. You're not halfway done. You haven't shipped a real feature in a year. Revenue is flat.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">You hired a "senior" dev who said they knew what they were doing.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Three months in, you realize they're a mid-level dev with confidence. You're paying $150K/year. They've shipped one feature. It broke production twice.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Someone on Reddit said "just use microservices."</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">You have 3 engineers. You're barely keeping the monolith running. Now they want to split it into 12 services. You have no idea if this will help or kill you.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Your tech stack is held together with duct tape.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">Every new feature breaks 3 old ones. You're afraid to touch anything. New hires take one look at the codebase and quit. You're embarrassed to show it to anyone.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-3">Monolith or microservices?</p>
                <p class="lead mb-3">Rewrite or refactor?</p>
                <p class="lead mb-3">Fire the dev or fix the process?</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">Is this hire actually senior?</p>

                        <p class="fs-4 fw-bold mb-0">Get it wrong and you'll waste 6 months and $200K fixing it.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">I've seen $50M rewrites that never shipped. Teams paralyzed by "senior" hires who made everything worse. Startups that scaled their architecture before finding customers. Enterprises that moved so slow they got eaten by competitors.</p>

                <p class="mb-5">27 years. Built and sold a SaaS. Still run production systems. I know what breaks.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled mb-5">
                    <li class="mb-2">Should you rewrite this? (Usually no)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Are your devs the problem? (Usually not the only problem)</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Is this hire actually good? How do you tell?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">How do you break down features that actually ship?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">What's the quickest fix vs the ideal solution vs the practical middle ground?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Where should AI generate vs where should humans maintain?</li>
