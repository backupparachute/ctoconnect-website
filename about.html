                <p class="lead mb-5 text-center">I've spent my career building software at every scale. More importantly, I've seen every way these decisions go wrong.</p>

                        <h3 class="handwritten fs-2 text-purple mb-4">Where I've Worked</h3>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-0">
                            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Fortune 500s:</strong> Where process matters and scale kills you. I've seen enterprise teams move so slow they got eaten by competitors.</li>
                            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Startups:</strong> Where speed beats perfection and tech debt is a feature. I've seen companies scale their architecture before finding customers.</li>
                            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Military:</strong> Where security isn't optional and downtime costs lives.</li>
                            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Hedge funds:</strong> Where correctness under pressure is everything.</li>
                            <li class="mb-0"><strong>SaaS:</strong> Where uptime is revenue and outages are existential. I built and sold a SaaS. Still run production systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold mb-0">I've rescued teams from every expensive mistake. So you can avoid them.</p>

                <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-4 handwritten text-teal text-center">What I've Seen Fail</h2>

                <p class="mb-3">$50M rewrites that never shipped.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">Teams paralyzed by "senior" hires who made everything worse.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">Startups that scaled their architecture before finding customers.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">Enterprises that moved so slow they got eaten by competitors.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Solo founders who built fast with AI but had no idea what was about to break.</p>

                <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-4 handwritten text-purple text-center">The Short Version</h2>

                <p class="mb-3">Founder with one exit. SaaS operator who understands both product and sales.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">25+ years delivering software for Fortune 500s, hedge funds, government agencies, and fast-moving startups.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">Fractional CTO trusted by companies earning hundreds of thousands to millions in revenue.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">I help dev teams ship what customers actually need, not just what they asked for.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-bold mb-5">I don't have all the answers. But I've probably seen your situation before.</p>
